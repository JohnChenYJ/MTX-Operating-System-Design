## 7.File System
```
Designed a file system includes following commands:
              -------  LEVEL 1 ------------ 
               mount_root;
               mkdir, rmdir, ls, cd, pwd;
               creat, link,  unlink, symlink
               stat,  chmod, touch;
              -------  LEVEl 2 -------------
               open,  close,  read,  write
               lseek  cat,    cp,    mv
              -------  LEVEl 3 ------------ 
               mount, umount
              -----------------------------
All the commands works exactly the same way as they do in Unix/Linux.
```

## Acknowledge
The works are done based on the Linux system and C programming language. The whole work designs and simulates a complete file system. I want to specially thank Professor KC Wang for his teaching.

## Reference

The code was implemented based on the book Design and Implementation of the MTX Operating System, K.C. Wang, Springer International AG, 2015. 

## Acknowledge
This course is taken in 2017 Fall, it's really an interesting and useful class. It not only helpes me understand the operation systems clearly, but also helps me improve my C programming language skills dramatically .
